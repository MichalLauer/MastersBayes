Because the prior distributions introduced in Chapter @sec-nvda-sv are generally acceptable for bayesian TSD analysis,
the same vague priors will be used. Overview of convergence quality through the Shrinkage factor and ESS is available
in Table @tbl-tui-sv-shrinkage-ess.

Table: TUI1.DE/SV: Shrinkage factors and ESS. {#tbl-tui-sv-shrinkage-ess}

|Parameter | Shrinkage|      ESS|
|:-----|---------:|--------:|
|phi   | 0.9998893| 22171.49|
|mu    | 1.0000194| 31179.89|
|$\nu_\text{in}$ | 0.9999342| 31692.03|
|$\nu_\text{la}$ | 1.0000120| 38679.67|

The Shrinkage factor suggests that chains have merged successfully and high ESS that statistical inference is viable.
The overview of all posterior distributions can be seen in Table @tbl-tui-post.

It is interesting that the results are very close to the SV model estimated on ticker NVDA. This may suggest that the
underlying volatility is very similar. The stochastic process is displayed on Figure @fig-nvda-tui-sv-volatility.

There can be seen increases and decreases in volatility in time which may suggest volatility clustering. Further,
the model is able to peaks of volatility as well as the decrease that follows. Comparison between volatility and
log returns is on Figure @fig-tui-sv-prediction.

The chart further shows that the estimated volatility fits well to the log returns. Periods of high and low
volatility all overall captured in the percentile intervals. The SV model fits the data fairly well.
