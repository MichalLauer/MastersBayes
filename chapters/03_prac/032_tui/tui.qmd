The second application will use the ticker TUI1.DE, representing TUI Group, a travel agency operating across Europe.
The analyzed time range is the same as for NVDA. The time series can be seen in Figure @fig-tui-raw

![Closing price for ticker TUI1.DE](./img/tui/closing.png){#fig-tui-raw}

There is no apparent growth, and the underlying close price oscillates around 8. The log returns can be seen on Figure
@fig-tui-logret.

![Log returns for ticker TUI1.DE](./img/tui/logret.png){#fig-tui-logret}

The log returns exhibit periods of high and low volatility. The greatest day-to-day change is around 10 % in both
directions. The autocorrelation can also be observed in Figure @fig-tui-pacf.

The charts show historical spikes in ACF and PACF functions, suggesting that volatility modeling might be appropriate.
Only the SV model will be used to model the underlying volatility for a couple of reasons. First, research presented in
the theoretical part suggests that SV models are more suitable for many TSD analyses because of their high flexibility
through two stochastic processes. Secondly, analysis of NVDA showed that the SV model can capture the underlying
volatility more precisely. Visual analysis showed that it outperformed volatility prediction from both ARCH and
GARCH models. Finally, including another full comparison of various ARCH/GARCH/SV models would have minimal benefit
because the interpretation of Bayesian models has been thoroughly introduced in the last chapters. Doing so would also
significantly exceed the page count requirements of this thesis.
