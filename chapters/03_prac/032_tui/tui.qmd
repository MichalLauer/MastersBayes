The second application will use the ticker TUI1.DE that represents TUI Group, a travel agency that operates across
europe. The analyzed time range is the same as for NVDA. The time series can be seen in Figure @fig-tui-raw

![Closing price for ticker TUI1.DE](./img/tui/closing.png){#fig-tui-raw}

There is no apparent growth and the underlying close price is oscillating around 8. The log returns can be seen on 
Figure @fig-tui-logret.

![Log returns for ticker TUI1.DE](./img/tui/logret.png){#fig-tui-logret}

The log returns exhibit periods of high and low volatility, The greatest day-to-day change is around 10 % in both
directions. The autocorrelation can be also observed on Figure @fig-tui-pacf.

The charts show historical spikes in both ACF and PACF functions. This suggest that volatility modeling might be
appropriate. To model the underlying volatility, only the SV model will be used for a couple of reasons. First,
research presented in the theoretical part suggests that SV models are more suitable for a lot of TSD analysis because
of their high flexibility through two stochastic processes. Secondly, analysis of NVDA showed that the SV model is
capable of capturing the underlying volatility in a more precise way and visual analysis showed that it outperformed
volatility prediction from both ARCH and GARCH models. Finally, including another full comparison of various
ARCH/GARCH/SV models would have minimal benefit because the interpretation of bayesian models has been thoroughly
introduced in the last chapters. Doing so would also significantly exceeded the page count requirements of this thesis.
