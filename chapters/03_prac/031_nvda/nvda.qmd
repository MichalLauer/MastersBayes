The development of closing price is nonstationary because the mean is not time-invariant. Issue of heteroskedasticity
is also apparent and the volatility of return in 2022 is much smaller than in the peak of 2024. The log returns are
visualized in @fig-nvda-logret, statistical description is provided in Table @tbl-nvda-logret.

Table: Description of log returns of NVDA

|Start    |End      |   n|Average |Variance |St. dev. |Min   |Max  |
|:--------|:--------|---:|:-------|:--------|:--------|:-----|:----|
|19083.00 |20175.00 | 750|0.00    |0.00     |0.04     |-0.17 |0.24 |

From a visual inspection, it looks like the log returns have constant mean of zero with small standard deviation of
0.04. This is also supported by literature review and a zero mean is usually expected. The growth in the last years can
be attributed to the growth of AI as NVIDIA is the main producer of graphical cards and chips that are deeply connected
to expansion of AI. The volatility could be caused by political instability, such as the tariff war between USA and
China that happened after president Trump has been selected for his second term. The war in ukraine that started in
2021 also increased tension around Taiwan, where resides the main producer of chips around the world, TSMC.

The ACF and PACF of squared log returns and the absolute returns is shown in Figure @fig-nvda-pacf.

The top line shows the PACF and ACF functions of squared log returns while the bottom row shows the PACF and ACF
of absolute values. It is apparent that the series suffers from non-linear dependence. This implies that volatility clustering can become an issue and models of conditional volatility could be helpful.
