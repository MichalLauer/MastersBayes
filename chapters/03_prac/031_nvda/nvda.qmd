The first analyzed financial asset is the closing stock price of Nvidia Corporation under the ticker NVDA. The closing
price is visualized in Figure @fig-nvda-raw.

The development of the closing price is nonstationary because the mean is not time-invariant. The issue of
heteroskedasticity is also apparent and the volatility of returns in 2022 is much smaller than in the peak of 2024. The
log returns are visualized in Figure @fig-nvda-logret, and a statistical description is provided in Table
@tbl-nvda-logret.

Table: Description of log returns of NVDA {#tbl-nvda-logret}

|Start      |End        |   n|Average |Variance |St. dev. |Min     |Max    |

From a visual inspection, the log returns have a constant mean. The literature review also supports this; a zero mean
is usually expected. The growth in the last years can be attributed to the growth of AI, as NVIDIA is the main producer
of graphical cards and chips that are deeply connected to the expansion of AI. The volatility could be caused by
political instability, such as the tariff war between the USA and China after President Trump was elected for his
second term. The war in Ukraine that started in 2021 also increased tension around Taiwan, where the main producer of
chips worldwide resides, TSMC.

The ACF and PACF of squared log returns and the absolute returns are shown in Figure @fig-nvda-pacf.

The top line shows the PACF and ACF functions of squared log returns, while the bottom row shows the PACF and ACF of
absolute values. The series suffers from non-linear dependence, which implies that volatility clustering can become an
issue, and conditional volatility models could be helpful.
