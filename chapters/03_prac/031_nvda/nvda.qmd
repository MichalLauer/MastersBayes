The development of closing price is nonstationary because the mean is not time-invariant. Issue of heteroskedasticity
is also relevant, for example the periods of growth between 1st of September, 2023 and 1st of March, 2024 look more
variable than in the next period between 1st of March, 2024 and 1st of September, 2024. The log returns are visualized
in @fig-googl-logret where the red cross represents the worst day-to-day decrease while green cross the contrary.
Statistical description is provided in Table @tbl-googl-logret.

Table: Description of log returns of GOOGL {#tbl-googl-logret}

|Start      |End        |n      |Average |Variance |St. dev. |Min   |Max  |
|:----------|:----------|:------|:-------|:--------|:--------|:-----|:----|
|2022-04-01 |2025-03-28 |750    |0.00    |0.00     |0.02     |-0.07 |0.14 |

From a visual inspection, it looks like the log returns have constant mean of zero with small standard deviation of
0.02. This is also supported by literature review and a zero mean is usually expected. The series still suffers from
heteroskedasticity where periods of high and low volatility can be observed. The largest loss can be observed on 25th
of October, 2023. Experts argue it was cause by poor quarterly financial earning \parencite{WSJ2023_StockMarketNews}.
The greatest day-to-day change can be observed on 26th of April, 2024. This can be attributed to quarterly records that
overcame all expectations \parencite{Chudoba2024_DobraCislaAlphabetu}.
