To compare models, visual inspection provides a significant insight about the quality of estimated volatility.
Comparing Figures @fig-nvda-arch-post-final, @fig-nvda-garch-post-final and @fig-nvda-sv-prediction, it is clear that
the stochastic model is able to most reliably estimate underlying asset volatility. The process can react well to
periods of low and high volatility as well as extreme values that can be observed in the middle of years 2023 and 2024.
The comparison is done on in-sample predictions of log returns and thus the results might not properly reflect
out-of-sample prediction quality.

The estimation times of the three best models are very similar and differ largely based on the device. For example,
MacBook Pro M3 was able to estimate the best ARCH and GARCH model in around 5 - 6 minutes while the SV model took
around 8. Estimation of ARCH and GARCH models was straight forward, but the SV model needed to be fine tuned and in
more complex analysis or with more data, the model would need to be reparametrized and the sampling process fine-tuned.
Alternatively, introduced packages could also be used for more efficient estimation.

The main issue encountered with the SV model was complexity through the variance parameter of student distribution. In
Stan, it is possible to define Student distribution with degrees of freedom $\nu$, mean $\mu$ and standard deviation
$\sigma$. In initial runs, SV model had additional parameter $\sigma$ to allow for larger flexibility through the
latent variable. This definition was unable to fit, the ESS was small, Shrink factor often exceeded 1.5 and the Stan
sampler threw warnings that the final chains might be missing some important samples through low BFMI. Even with a
large number of iterations (64 000) and a large warm-up period (8 000), the model was unable to converge. This would
imply that any inference was very unreliable and undesirable. After removing the $\sigma$ parameter and setting the
standard deviation to a fixed value, the convergence run without any issues and finished relatively quickly. The model with fixed standard deviation also fits the data fairly well
