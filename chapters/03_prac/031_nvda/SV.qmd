The last estimated model belongs to the class of stochastic volatility models. The definition of the SV model, provided
in Chapter @sec-sv, is different from regular ARCH/GARCH models, and different priors must be selected. The first
parameter is the so-called log volatility persistence $\phi$. For the model to be stationary, $\phi$ must be in
$\langle -1, 1 \rangle$. To overcome this limitation, parameter $\phi_\text{raw}$ is modeled using a Beta distribution
and the parameter $\phi$ is obtained by transforming it as

$$
\phi = 2 * \phi_\text{raw} - 1.
$$

This changes the range of parameter $\phi_\text{raw}$ from $\langle 0,1 \rangle$ so that $\phi \in \langle -1, 1 \rangle$.
Because high persistence is common in financial TSD, more probability is put to the tails rather than the center. The
transformed prior distribution is in Figure @fig-nvda-sv-apr-phi.

![NVDA/SV: Prior distribution for $\phi$.](./img/nvda/sv/apriori_phi.png){#fig-nvda-sv-apr-phi}

The implied 89% PI is $(-0.95, 0.95)$, which offers a wide range of possible values. The persistence is expected to be
equally likely positive and negative. Another parameter that needs to be estimated is $\mu$, the mean expected
volatility. The prior distribution is $Half-N(0, 1)$ because the mean volatility is restricted to positive values only.
The full prior is shown in Figure @fig-nvda-sv-apr-mu.

![NVDA/SV: Prior distribution for $\mu$.](./img/nvda/sv/apriori_mu.png){#fig-nvda-sv-apr-mu}

Parameter $\mu$ is expected in the 89% PI of $(0.07, 1.46)$. This interval covers a wide range of probable average
volatility. Finally, the SV models work with two stochastic components - the innovations for $p$ and the random shock
$\eta$. Because the model will work with TSD, they are considered to have Student's distribution with individual
parameters $\nu_\text{in}$ for the innovations and $\nu_\text{la}$ for the random shock accompanied in the latent
variable. Combining two stochastic components could enable greater explanation power of log returns and the
distributions may not suffer from heavy tails. As such, the prior distribution for both parameters is visualized in
Figure @fig-nvda-sv-apr-nu.

![NVDA/SV: Prior distribution for $\nu_\text{in}$ and $\nu_\text{la}$.](./img/nvda/sv/apriori_nu.png){#fig-nvda-sv-apr-nu}

The 89% PI ranges from 8.56 to 41.55, which suggests to the model that the parameters can vary. The whole model could
be written as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p_t &\sim \exp\left({h_t\over2} \right)\epsilon_t \\
\epsilon_t &\sim T(\nu_\text{in}) \\
\nu_\text{in} &\sim \Gamma(\alpha = 4.5, \beta = 0.2) \\
h_t &\sim T(\nu_\text{la}, \mu = \mu + \phi(h_{t-1} - \mu), \sigma = 1) \\
\nu_\text{la} &\sim \Gamma(\alpha = 4.5, \beta = 0.2) \\
\mu &\sim \text{Half-N}(0, 1)
\end{aligned}
$$

Because only one SV model is estimated, the Shrinkage factor and ESS that monitor the quality of convergence are both
described in Table @tbl-nvda-sv-shrinkage-ess.

Table: NVDA/SV: Shrinkage factors. {#tbl-nvda-sv-shrinkage-ess}

|param | Shrinkage|      ESS|
|:-----|---------:|--------:|
|phi   | 1.00     |   22 926|
|mu    | 1.00     |   28 228|
|nu_in | 1.00     |   34 132|
|nu_la | 1.00     |   39 875|

The model was estimated on identical settings as previous models. The Shrinkage factor and ESS are both satisfactory.
The chains merged adequately and the smallest ESS is sufficient for further statistical inference. The posterior
distribution for parameter $\phi$ is in Figure @fig-nvda-sv-post-phi.

![NVDA/SV: Posterior distribution for $\phi$.](./img/nvda/sv/posterior_phi.png){#fig-nvda-sv-post-phi}

Compared to the prior distribution, the posterior is heavily skewed towards one, suggesting high positive volatility
persistence. The description of the posterior is in Table @tbl-nvda-sv-post-phi.

Table: NVDA/SV: Tabular posterior description for $\phi$. {#tbl-nvda-sv-post-phi}

|Average |SD     |PI$_{0.055}$ |PI$_{0.945}$ |
|:-------|:------|:--------|:--------|
|0.9925  |0.0041 |0.9853   |0.9984   |

The 89% PI interval implies that the previous latent variable's effect is probably between 0.9853 and 0.9984. The
expected persistence is 0.99, with a very low standard deviation, suggesting a tight posterior. The posterior
distribution for $\mu$ is visualized in Figure @fig-nvda-sv-post-mu.

![NVDA/SV: Posterior distribution for $\mu$.](./img/nvda/sv/posterior_mu.png){#fig-nvda-sv-post-mu}

The peak of the posterior distribution is between 0 and 0.5, suggesting low average volatility. Description is provided
in Table @tbl-nvda-sv-post-mu.

Table: NVDA/SV: Tabular posterior description for $\mu$. {#tbl-nvda-sv-post-mu}

|Average |SD     |PI$_{0.055}$ |PI$_{0.945}$ |
|:-------|:------|:--------|:--------|
|0.65  |0.54 |0.05   |1.68   |

The average volatility is expected to be 0,65 with 89% PI of $(0.05, 1.68)$.Interestingly, this posterior interval is
wider than the prior expectation. Finally, estimated degrees of freedom of both stochastic elements are in Figure
@fig-nvda-sv-post-nu.

![NVDA/SV: Posterior distribution for $\nu$.](./img/nvda/sv/posterior_nu.png){#fig-nvda-sv-post-nu}

The red posterior distribution describes degrees of freedom $\nu_{in}$ for the observed log returns while the blue
posterior is for latent variable's random shock. Posteriors are described in Table @tbl-nvda-sv-post-nu.

Table: NVDA/SV: Tabular description of posteriors for $\nu$. {#tbl-nvda-sv-post-nu}

|Parameter |Average |SD      |PI$_{0.055}$ |PI$_{0.945}$ |
|:---------|:-------|:-------|:--------|:--------|
| $\nu_\text{in}$ |30.45 |10.99 |15.89  |50.31  |
| $\nu_\text{la}$ |37.97 |11.68 |22.07  |58.84  |

The 89% PI highly overlaps, which suggests that the degrees of freedom for both stochastic processes are not so
different. The results suggest that the model can capture large volatility with degrees of freedom around 30, and a
normally distributed shock or innovations could also be considered. The implied volatility is visualized on Figure
@fig-nvda-sv-volatility.

![NVDA/SV: Estimated volatility.](./img/nvda/sv/posterior_volatility.png){#fig-nvda-sv-volatility}

The volatility is very dynamic and variable. Periods of low and high volatility can be observed, and volatility
clustering is also present. The comparison against observed log returns is in Figure @fig-nvda-sv-prediction.

![NVDA/SV: Volatility prediction.](./img/nvda/sv/posterior_prediction.png){#fig-nvda-sv-prediction}

The SV model can estimate periods of low and high volatility fairly well. Notably, most high and low log returns are
within the shaded PI. The volatility is also not overconfident, and the model can decrease implied volatility after
large spikes, such as the one in 2023.
