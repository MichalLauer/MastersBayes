Another approach to volatility modeling is to leave the assumption that volatility at time $t$ can be deterministically described by previous shocks and conditional variance. Instead, one can model volatility through latent variables
that are stochastic and unobserved. This idea is employed in Stochastic volatility (SV) models, which are special 
types of state-space models \parencite[Chap. 11.2]{al-tsay_analysis_2005}.
