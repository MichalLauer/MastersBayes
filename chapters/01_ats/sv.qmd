Another approach to volatility modeling is to leave the assumption that volatility at time $t$ can be deterministically described by previous shocks and conditional variance. Instead, one can model volatility through a latent variable
that is stochastic and unobserved. This idea is employed in Stochastic volatility (SV) models, which are special 
types of state-space models \parencite[Chap. 11.2]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}.

The initial equation is similar as the ARCH equation in @eq-var-arch and GARCH equation in @eq-var-garch, where the log of
returns $p_t$ is described
by the mean equation at time $t$ and shock at time $t$. For SV models, the log returns are assumed to be centered and

$$
p_t = \sigma_t \epsilon_t,
$$ {#eq-main-sv}

where $\epsilon_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2_\epsilon)$. The main difference is that the shock is not described deterministically by
squared historical shocks and conditional variance, but rather by a latent variable $h_t$ that represents the natural logarithm of
variance. This is because variance can be only non-negative, and modeling the log variance enforces this assumption. It can then
be described by

$$
\ln \sigma^2 = h_t.
$$

The volatility can be expressed by

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ln \sigma^2 &= h_t \\
\sigma^2     &= \exp(h_t) \\
\sigma       &= \exp\left({h_t\over2} \right).
\end{aligned}
$$

Plugging this into @eq-main-sv, the simple SV model becomes clear and

$$
p_t = \exp\left({h_t\over2} \right)\epsilon_t.
$$

The latent variable is described by an autoregressive process

$$
h_{t+1} = \mu + \phi(h_t - \mu) + \eta_t,
$$

where $\mu$ represents the average log volatility, $\phi$ the log volatility persistence and $\eta\sim N(0, \sigma^2_\eta)$. For the 
latent variable to be stationary, it is sufficient that $|\phi| < 1$ \parencite{Kim1998_StochasticVolatilityLH}. The addition of
another random shocks in the form of $\eta_t$ makes the SV model more flexible and this can capture more complex relationships.
The estimation of latent variable $h_t$ is non-trivial and several methods have been developed, including Kalman filtering and
Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Similar to GARCH models, the simple SV model is unable to capture the effect of positive
and negative spikes \parencite[Chap. 3.12]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}. However, additional extensions have been developed
to capture the asymmetric property in financial TSD.
