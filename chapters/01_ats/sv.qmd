Another approach to volatility modeling is to leave the assumption that volatility at time $t$ can be deterministically
described by previous shocks and conditional variance. Instead, one can model volatility through a latent variable that
is stochastic and unobserved. This idea is employed in Stochastic volatility (SV) models, special types of state-space
models \parencite[Chap. 11.2]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}.

The initial equation is similar to the ARCH Equation @eq-var-arch and GARCH Equation @eq-var-garch, where the log of
returns $p_t$ is described by the mean equation at time $t$ and shock at time $t$. For SV models, the log returns are
assumed to be centered and

$$
p_t = \sigma_t \epsilon_t,
$$ {#eq-main-sv}

where $\epsilon_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2_\epsilon)$. The main difference is that the shock is not described
deterministically by squared historical shocks and conditional variance but rather by a latent variable $h_t$
representing the natural logarithm of variance. This is because variance can only be non-negative, and modeling the log
variance enforces this assumption. It can then be described by

$$
\ln \sigma^2 = h_t.
$$

The volatility can be expressed by

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ln \sigma^2 &= h_t \\
\sigma^2 &= \exp(h_t) \\
\sigma &= \exp\left({h_t\over2} \right).
\end{aligned}
$$

Plugging this into @eq-main-sv, the simple SV model emerges as

$$
p_t = \exp\left({h_t\over2} \right)\epsilon_t.
$$

An autoregressive process describes the latent variable as

$$
h_{t+1} = \mu + \phi(h_t - \mu) + \eta_t,
$$

where $\mu$ represents the average log volatility, $\phi$ the log volatility persistence and $\eta\sim N(0,
\sigma^2_\eta)$. For the latent variable to be stationary, it is sufficient that $|\phi| < 1$
\parencite{Kim1998_StochasticVolatilityLH}. The addition of another random shock in the form of $\eta_t$ makes the SV
model more flexible, which can capture more complex relationships. The estimation of latent variable $h_t$ is
non-trivial, and several methods have been developed, including Kalman filtering and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.
Like GARCH models, the simple SV model cannot capture the effect of positive and negative spikes
\parencite[Chap. 3.12]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}. However, additional extensions have been developed to capture
the asymmetric property in financial TSD. Similarly to the GARCH-M model, an SV-in-Mean model is introduced in
\parencite{Abanto-ValleEtAl2011_StochasticVolatilityMean} that utilizes the volatility to influence returns directly.
