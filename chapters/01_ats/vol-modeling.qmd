Conditional heteroskedastic models can been used to combat time-variant volatility and volatility clustering. One of
the most popular and traditional models assumes that the volatility at time $t$ can be computed deterministically by
its past values. Typically, these models are represented by autoregressive functions of squared residuals and
historical conditional variance. Although harder to estimate, this method has proven beneficial, especially in TSD
analysis \parencite{FernandezRodriguez2020_ModelingVolatilityReturns}.

A newer approach assumes that the volatility at time $t$ is modeled through a latent variable that is also
autoregressively updated. This method has become popular because of its ability to capture more complex relationships
than deterministic models. Estimating such models is challenging because analysts need to estimate latent variables
that are not observed. Some specialized methods have been developed to counter this issue, and using Bayesian
simulations is a popular choice. Some authors argue that the additional stochasticity through latent variables improves
model fitting and predictions \parencite{FernandezRodriguez2020_ModelingVolatilityReturns}, while others argue that the
out-of-sample predictions do not differ much \parencite[Chap. 3.12]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}.
