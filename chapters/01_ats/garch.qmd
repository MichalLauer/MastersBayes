The variance for the ARCH$(p)$ model given in Equation @eq-var-arch is simple and effective but sometimes inadequate
for real data. The general autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model, proposed by
\parencite{Bollerslev1986_GeneralizedAutoregressiveConditional}, is more flexible and offers better long-term memory
for forecasting \parencite{AL-Najjar2016_ModellingEstimationVolatility}. GARCH models extend ARCH shock by lagged
estimated conditional variance. In general, the GARCH model of order p and q can be written as

$$
p_t = \mu_t + a_t,
$$

where the shock $a_t$ is made up by deterministic component $\sigma_t$ and stochastic component $\epsilon_t$. The main
difference is in $\sigma_t$, which is given by \parencite[Eq. 2]{AL-Najjar2016_ModellingEstimationVolatility} as

$$
\sigma_t^2 = \alpha_0 + \sum_{i=1}^p \alpha_i a^2_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^q \beta_j \sigma_{t-j}^2.
$$ {#eq-var-garch}

The main difference between ARCH$(p)$ model and GARCH$(p, q)$ model is the sum of past conditional variances given in
Equation @eq-var-garch. Coefficient $\beta_i$ must be greater than zero and in addition to the ARCH stationarity
constraints, it must hold that $\sum_{i=1}^p \alpha_i + \sum_{i=1}^q \beta_i < 1$. This condition
implies that the shock $a_t$ is finite and conditional variance $\sigma^2$ evolves over time
\parencite[Chap. 3.5]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}.

New $\beta$ coefficients introduce additional complexity, and assessing the order of the GARCH model is a complex task.
In practice, only lower orders are used. To estimate a GARCH model, a recursive method is feasible, which first
estimates a simple ARCH$(p)$ model. From the estimated residuals $a_t$ and conditional variance $\sigma^2_t$, new
GARCH$(p, q)$ model is computed. This process creates new residuals $a_t$ and conditional variance $\sigma^2_t$, which
can be used to fit a new GARCH$(p, q)$ model. This procedure is repeated until a stopping criterion is met. The same
procedure as for the ARCH model can be used to forecast new values, and arbitrary $\ell$-step ahead prediction is
available in \parencite[Chap. 3.5]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}

Although the GARCH$(p, q)$ model has some drawbacks, extensions have been developed to improve volatility forecasts.
One popular extension is the Exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model
\parencite{Nelson1991_ConditionalHeteroskedasticityAsset}, which can capture asymmetric shocks. This asymmetric
property means that positive and negative jumps in returns can have various effects on the implied forecasted
volatility. Another extension, GARCH-in-Mean (GARCH-M) \parencite{EngleEtAl1987_EstimatingTimeVarying}, uses the
calculated conditional volatility from the GARCH model as a predictor to forecast returns. An overview of other, more
specific extensions that might be appropriate in specific domains is covered in
\parencite{AL-Najjar2016_ModellingEstimationVolatility} or \parencite{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}.
