The variance for ARCH(m) model given in Equation @eq-var-arch is simple and effective, but sometimes not adequate for 
real data. General autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model, proposed by Boreslav 
\parencite{Bollerslev1986_GeneralizedAutoregressiveConditional}, is
more flexible and offer better long-term memory for forecasting \parencite{AL-Najjar2016_ModellingEstimationVolatility}. GARCH
models extend ARCH shock by lagged estimated variance. In general, the GARCH model of order p and q can be
written as 

$$
p_t = \mu_t + a_t,
$$

where the shock $a_t$ is made up by deterministic component $\sigma_t$ and stochastic component $\epsilon_t$. 
The main difference is in $\sigma_t$, which is given by \parencite[Eq. 2]{AL-Najjar2016_ModellingEstimationVolatility} as

$$
\sigma_t^2 = \alpha_0 + \sum_{i=1}^p \alpha_i a^2_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^q \beta_j \sigma_{t-j}^2.
$$ {#eq-var-garch}

The main difference between ARCH$(p)$ model and GARCH$(p, q)$ model is the sum of past conditional
variances given in Equation @eq-var-garch. In addition to the ARCH constrains, for the GARCH $\beta$ coefficients it must hold
that $\beta_j \geq 0$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{\max (p, q)} (\alpha_i + \beta_i) < 1$. This condition implies that the 
shock $a_t$ is finite and conditional variance $\sigma^2$ evolves over time 
\parencite[Chap. 3.5]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}. 

New $\beta$ coefficients introduce complexity and assessing the order of GARCH model is a complex task. In practice,
only lower orders are used. To estimate a GARCH model, a recursive method is feasible which first estimates a simple
ARCH$(p)$ model. From the estimated residuals $a_t$ and conditional variance $\sigma^2_t$, new 
GARCH$(p, q)$ model is computed. This creates new residuals $a_t$ and conditional variance $\sigma^2_t$, which can
be used to fit a new GARCH$(p, q)$ model. This procedure is repeated until a stopping criterion is met. To forecast
new values, the same procedure as for the ARCH model can be used and arbitrary $\ell$-step ahead prediction is 
available \parencite[Chap. 3.5]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}

Although the GARCH$(p, q)$ model has some drawbacks, extensions have been developed to improve volatility forecasts.
One popular extension is the Exponential generalized auto regressive conditional heteroscedasticity (EGARCH) model,
that is able to capture asymmetric shocks. This means that positive and negative jumps in returns can have various
effect on the implied forecasted volatility. Another extensions, GARCH-in-Mean (GARCH-M), uses the calculated 
conditional volatility from GARCH model as a predictor to forecast returns. Overview of other, more specific
extensions that might be appropriate in specific domains, are covered in \parencite{AL-Najjar2016_ModellingEstimationVolatility} or
\parencite{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}.
