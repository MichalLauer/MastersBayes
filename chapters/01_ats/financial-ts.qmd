Financial data and time series analysis can be loosely defined as *analysis that is concerned with the theory and 
practice of asset valuation over time* \parencite[Chap. 1]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}. Key feature that distinguishes 
financial TSD from other domains is volatility, which originates from both not unified theory and variable data.
A simple term, such as asset volatility, can have different definitions, which complicates statistical analysis
and empirical research. The volatility of data itself is also hardly measurable and data that changes quickly
(such as returns or closing price) can experience different periods of different volatility 
\parencite[Chap. 1]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}.

In financial statistical analysis, it is often beneficial to work with returns and not pure prices. In fact, most of
the current research in finance is focused on returns \parencite[Chap. 1]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}. They offer
scale-free metric that measure how well a trader performs, no matter the volume. They have also good statistical
properties which are beneficial in TSD analysis. One of those is stationarity that describes constant first and 
second moments \parencite[Chap. 1.4]{CampbellEtAl1998_ECONOMETRICSFINANCIALMARKETS}.

There are different methods on how to calculate returns \parencite[Chap. 1.1]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}. The simplest
returns at time $t$ are called simple gross returns, and are denoted as

$$
1 + R_t = {P_t \over P_{t-1}},
$$ {#eq-simple-returns}

where $P_t$ denotes the price of the underlying asset at time $t$ and $R_t$ the net return. Equation @eq-simple-returns
can also be interpreted as a simple growth index between two consecutive time periods. Extension of this are log 
returns, which can be defined as

$$
r_t =
\ln \left( 1 + R_t \right) =
\ln \left( {P_t \over P_{t-1}} \right) =
\ln P_t - \ln P_{t-1} = p_t - p_{t-1},
$$ {#eq-log-returns}

where $p_t$ denotes the natural logarithm of price at time $t$. This transformation is beneficial in two ways. First,
it is simple to write the compound growth in time as a simple sum. Considering growth the past $h$ records, it can
be computed that

$$
\ln \left( {P_{t-h+1} \over P_{t-h}} * \dots * {P_{t-1} \over P_{t-2}} * {P_t \over P_{t-1}} \right) =
\ln \left( {P_{t-h+1} \over P_{t-h}} \right) + \dots + \ln \left( {P_{t-1} \over P_{t-2}} \right) + \ln \left( {P_t \over P_{t-1}} \right) =
\sum_{i=t-h+1}^t p_i.
$$

Another important property touches statistical analysis and the fact that natural logarithm is often easier to analyze
\parencite[Chap. 1.1]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}.

\parencite[Chap. 1]{Cont2007_VolatilityClusteringFinancial} provides an overview of some statistical properties that have been
observed on financial returns. Volatility of a financial asset is positively correlated with it's traded volume.
Volatility clustering is also usually observed and large changes are typically followed by large changes, while
small changes are typically followed by small changes. These changes, however, can be in a different direction and
relatively high returns or losses can be observed together. While these returns are typically not correlated, their
absolute value experiences autocorrelation with slow decay. Finally, unconditional distribution of returns displays
heavy tails.

If a financial time series experiences volatility clustering, it is inherently not stationary, as it's variance
is not constant. As \parencite[Chap. 1]{Cont2007_VolatilityClusteringFinancial} suggests, this issue has lead to a development
of new models that are specifically designed to handle periods of high and low time series volatility.
