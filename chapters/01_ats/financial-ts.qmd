Financial data and time series analysis can be loosely defined as *\enquote{analysis that is concerned with the theory and
practice of asset valuation over time}* \parencite[Chap. 1]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}. A key feature
distinguishing financial TSD from other domains is volatility, which originates from both nonunified theory and
variable data. A simple term, such as asset volatility, can have different definitions, complicating statistical
analysis and empirical research. Data volatility is also hardly measurable, and data that changes quickly (such as
returns or closing price) can experience periods of different volatility
\parencite[Chap. 1]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}.

In financial statistical analysis, working with returns and not pure prices is often beneficial. Most of the current
research in finance is focused on returns \parencite[Chap. 1]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}. They offer scale-free
metrics that measure a trader's performance, no matter the volume. They also have good statistical properties
beneficial in TSD analysis \parencite[Chap. 1.4]{CampbellEtAl1998_ECONOMETRICSFINANCIALMARKETS}.

There are different methods on how to calculate returns \parencite[Chap. 1.1]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}. The
simplest returns at time $t$ are called simple gross returns and are denoted as

$$
1 + R_t = {P_t \over P_{t-1}},
$$ {#eq-simple-returns}

where $P_t$ denotes the price of the underlying asset at time $t$ and $R_t$ the net return. Equation @eq-simple-returns
can also be interpreted as a simple growth index between two consecutive periods. Extension of this are log returns,
which can be defined as

$$
r_t =
\ln \left( 1 + R_t \right) =
\ln \left( {P_t \over P_{t-1}} \right) =
\ln P_t - \ln P_{t-1} = p_t - p_{t-1},
$$ {#eq-log-returns}

where $p_t$ denotes the natural logarithm of price at time $t$. This transformation is beneficial in two ways. First,
it is simple to write the compound growth in time as a simple sum. Considering the growth in the past $h$ records, it
can be computed that

$$
\ln \left( {P_{t-h+1} \over P_{t-h}} * \dots * {P_{t-1} \over P_{t-2}} * {P_t \over P_{t-1}} \right) =
\ln \left( {P_{t-h+1} \over P_{t-h}} \right) + \dots + \ln \left( {P_{t-1} \over P_{t-2}} \right) + \ln \left( {P_t \over P_{t-1}} \right) =
\sum_{i=t-h+1}^t p_i.
$$

Another important property touches statistical analysis and the fact that natural logarithm is often easier to analyze
\parencite[Chap. 1.1]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}.

\parencite[Chap. 1]{Cont2007_VolatilityClusteringFinancial} provides an overview of some statistical properties
observed on financial returns. The volatility of a financial asset is positively correlated with its traded volume.
Volatility clustering is also usually observed, and large changes typically follow large changes, while small changes
typically follow small changes. These changes, however, can be in a different direction, and relatively high returns or
losses can be observed together. While these returns are typically not correlated, their absolute value experiences
autocorrelation with slow decay. Finally, the unconditional distribution of returns displays heavy tails.

If a financial time series experiences volatility clustering, it is inherently not stationary, as the variance is not
constant. As \parencite[Chap. 1]{Cont2007_VolatilityClusteringFinancial} suggests this issue has led to the development
of new models specifically designed to handle periods of high and low time series volatility.
