Financial data and time series analysis can be loosely defined as *analysis that is concerned with the theory and 
practice of asset valuation over time.* \parencite[Chap. 1]{tsay_analysis_2005}. Key feature that distinguishes 
financial TSD from other domains is volatility, which originates from both not unified theory and variable data.
A simple term, such as asset volatility, can have different definitions, which complicates statistical analysis
and empirical research. The volatility of data itself is also hardly measurable and data that changes quickly
(such as returns or closing price) can experience different periods of different volatility 
\parencite[Chap. 1]{tsay_analysis_2005}.

In financial statistical analysis, it is often beneficial to work with returns and not pure prices. In fact, most of
the current research in finance is focused on returns \parencite[Chap. 1]{tsay_analysis_2005}. They offer
scale-free metric that measure how well a trader performs, no matter the volume. They have also good statistical
properties which are beneficial in TSD analysis. One of those is stationarity that describes constant first and 
second moments \parencite[Chap. 1.4]{campbell_econometrics_1998}.

There are different methods on how to calculate returns \parencite[Chap. 1.1]{tsay_analysis_2005}. The simplest
returns at time $t$ are called simple gross returns, and are denoted as

$$
1 + R_t = {P_t \over P_{t-1}},
$$ {#eq-simple-returns}

where $P_t$ denotes the price of the underlying asset at time $t$ and $R_t$ the net return. Equation @eq-simple-returns
can also be interpreted as a simple growth index between two consecutive time periods.Extension of this are log 
returns, which can be defined as

$$
r_t =
\ln \left( 1 + R_t \right) =
\ln \left( {P_t \over P_{t-1}} \right) =
\ln P_t - \ln P_{t-1} = p_t - p_{t-1},
$$ {#eq-log-returns}

where $p_t$ denotes the natural logarithm of price at time $t$. This transformation is beneficial in two ways. First,
it is simple to write the compound growth in time as a simple sum. Considering growth the past $h$ records, it can
be computed that

$$
\ln \left( {P_{t-h+1} \over P_{t-h}} * \dots * {P_{t-1} \over P_{t-2}} * {P_t \over P_{t-1}} \right) =
\ln \left( {P_{t-h+1} \over P_{t-h}} \right) + \dots + \ln \left( {P_{t-1} \over P_{t-2}} \right) + \ln \left( {P_t \over P_{t-1}} \right) =
\sum_{i=t-h+1}^t r_i.
$$

Another important property touches statistical analysis and the fact that natural logarithm is often easier to analyze
\parencite[Chap. 1.1]{tsay_analysis_2005}.
