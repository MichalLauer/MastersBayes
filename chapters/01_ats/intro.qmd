In statistical data analysis, there are several types of data that are distinguished by their key structure. Data that 
are independent of each other are called Cross-Sectional Data (CSD). They are usually obtained at random and one can 
assume that their order is not important; that is, individual records are independent. CSD often represent records
(individuals, animals, corporations, workers...) at a specific time period and time dependence is not analyzed

A lot of economical or financial records contain such time dependence. For example, simple data about unemployment,
GDP, investment return or inflation may depend on a value that was last observed. Such data are called Time Series Data
(TSD). Their key feature is that they are ordered by some key, usually a date or time. This ordering may
have effect on the data and further analysis and requires additional handling. This means that individual observations
are not independent. Ordering in this case matters. Further description and breakdown of more data structures offers

A time series can be decomposed into four parts. The overall average direction in which the time series changes is
called the trend component. It describes the tendency
of a time series to grow, shrink or stay the same. Seasonal component refers to a part of a time series that fluctuates
around the trend. Seasonality should repeat within one calendar year and can be connected to holidays or the 
season of the year. In data that spans across multiple years, fluctuation around the trend can be decomposed into a 
cyclical component. The main difference between them is related to regularity of each component. Seasonality represent 
regular periodic changes around the trend while cyclicality represent irregular periodicity around the trend. This decomposition is helpful in determining key characteristics of a time series. 
Identifying different components can help with forecasting and statistical inference
