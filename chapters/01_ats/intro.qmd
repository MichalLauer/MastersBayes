Analysis of time series data (TSD) can be more complicated that analysis of cross sectional data because of the time dimension that is inherently introduced.
Methods on data without time dependence often assume random sampling and identical, independent distribution of every data point. An example can be the 
MLR3 requirement defined in \parencite{Wooldridge2020_IntroductoryEconometricsModern} for Multiple Linear Regression estimated with Ordinary Least
Squares. It states that in order to get unbiased estimates $\hat\theta$ of the true population parameters $\theta$, every data points needs to be 
independent. In time series data, a point at time $t$ is dependent on values up-to time $t-1$ and this requirement is automatically violated.

\parencite{HindlsEtAl2018_StatistikaEkonomii} states that analysis of time series data is the most important analysis for economic data. All economic
data is *somehow* dependent on its past values and this dependence need to be reflected. One way of analyzing a time series is by forecasting future
values. This can be done using either point estimates or confidence intervals. Another approach, that is considered in this thesis, is the forecast
of future volatility. Because a lot of popular techniques, such as the Blackâ€“Scholes model, assume homoscedasticity, it is only natural to model
the underlying volatility.
