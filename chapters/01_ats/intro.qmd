Analysis of time series data (TSD) can be more complicated than analysis of cross-sectional data because of the time
dimension that is inherently introduced. Methods on data without time dependence often assume random sampling and
identical, independent distribution of every data point. An example can be the MLR3 requirement defined in
\parencite{Wooldridge2020_IntroductoryEconometricsModern} for Multiple Linear Regression estimated with Ordinary Least
Squares. It states that to get unbiased estimates $\hat\theta$ of the true population parameters $\theta$, every data
point needs to be independent. In time series data, a point at time $t$ is dependent on values up to time $t-1$, and
this requirement is automatically violated.

\parencite{HindlsEtAl2018_StatistikaEkonomii} states that analysis of time series data is the most important analysis
for economic data. All economic data is *somehow* dependent on its past values, and this dependence needs to be
reflected. One way of analyzing a time series is by forecasting future values, which can be done using either point
estimates or confidence intervals. Because many popular techniques, such as the Blackâ€“Scholes model, assume
homoskedasticity, it is only natural to model the underlying volatility.
