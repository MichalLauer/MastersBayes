Log returns in financial TSD analysis are serially uncorrelated but dependent. Figure @fig-log-ret-dep, taken from
\parencite[Fig. 3.1]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}, shows log returns of Intel Corporation from January 1973 to
December 2003.

The raw log returns on the top left shows no serial autocorrelation, except for some small spikes that could be due to
randomness. The other two transformations (absolute values, squares) exhibit dependence. Since the volatility is not
independent, using the past values for statistical modeling is viable.

The log returns could be described by

$$
p_t = \mu_t + a_t,
$$

where $p_t$ are the log returns at time $t$, $\mu_t$ is so-called mean equation at time $t$ and $a_t$ is the
shock[^shock] at time $t$. The mean equation is a model that describes the expected value at time $t$, given all
information up to $t-1$. It can be a simple $AR(p)$ or $ARIMA(p, d, q)$ process that is stationary. Shock at time $t$
describes the volatility at time $t$ with $\sigma_t$ and a random noise. This shock is the main focus of volatility
modeling \parencite[Fig. 3.2]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}.

[^shock]: Some authors also use the word *innovation*.

Let shock $a_t$ be defined as

$$
a_t = \sigma_t \epsilon_t,
$$

where $\epsilon_t$ represents a sequence of identically and independently distributed random variables with $\mu = 0$
and $\sigma^2 = 1$ and $\sigma_t$ is an autoregressive process

$$
\sigma^2_t = \alpha_0 + \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i a_{t-i}^2.
$$ {#eq-var-arch}

Put together, the model is called the Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) model of order $m$. Equation
@eq-var-arch states that the variance at time $t$ is affected by squared residuals in the previous $m$ periods. This
implies that if the volatility has been high, the volatility at time $t$ is also expected to be high. On the contrary,
the expected volatility at time $t$ is rather small in periods of low volatility. It is important to realize that high
volatility does not necessarily imply high realized variability. The probability of very high or very low returns is
greater but not guaranteed \parencite[Chap. 3.4]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}.

The random variable $\epsilon_t$ is often assumed to follow standard normal distribution. The student distribution
might be more suitable if the time series experiences heavy tails. Since the expected value of such distributions is
zero, the expected return at time $t$ is not affected, and it holds that

$$
E(p_t) = E(\mu_t) + E(a_t) = E(\mu_t).
$$


Because $\sigma^2$ is variance, it must be greater than zero, and as such, $\alpha_0 > 0$ and $\alpha_i \geq 0$ for $i
\in \mathbb{N}$.

In frequentist statistics, several ways exist to estimate the correct order of ARCH$(p)$. One of them is the Ljung-Box
statistic $Q(m)$ computed from the squared residuals $a_i^2$. Another popular method is the Lagrange multiplier test,
which is identical to the usual F-test in multiple regression. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is commonly used to
estimate such a model. Because this thesis focuses primarily on Bayesian methods and estimation, these methods will not
be leveraged, and further description and application are offered in
\parencite[Chap. 3]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}.

To use the ARCH$(p)$ model for forecasting, it is necessary to estimate historical residuals. One-step forecast for
ARCH$(p)$ model is made up of the mean equation that is generally unaffected by the forecasted volatility. After
computing historical predictions $\hat\mu_t$, it is necessary to compute residuals, which represent the historical
shock as

$$
\hat a_t = y_t - \hat \mu_t.
$$

These residual shocks are then used in the ARCH$(p)$ model to forecast future volatility as

$$
\hat \sigma_{t+1}^2 = \hat \alpha_0 + \sum_{i=1}^m \hat \alpha_i \hat a^2_{t - i + 1}.
$$

Forecasting equation can be generalized for arbitrary $\ell$-step ahead prediction \parencite[Chap. 3.4.3]

\parencite[Chap. 3.4.2]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime} summarizes the downsides of such models. One  
is the assumption that positive and negative spikes of residuals have the same effect on the current volatility.
Research has found this is false, and squared historical shocks might not reflect the true shock correctly. ARCH models
also tend to overestimate volatility in cases where a single shock has been observed. Simple ARCH models respond slowly
to quick changes and might not perform best.
