Log returns in financial TSD analysis are serially uncorrelated, but dependent. Figure @fig-log-ret-dep, taken 
from \parencite[Fig. 3.1]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}, shows log returns of Intel Corporation from January 1973 to
December 2003.

The raw log returns on the top left show that there is no serial autocorrelation, except for some small spikes
that could be due to randomness. The other two transformations (absolute values, squares) exhibit some type of
dependence. Since the volatility is not independent, it is viable to try to use the past values for 
statistical modeling.

The log returns could be described by 

$$
p_t = \mu_t + a_t,
$$

where $p_t$ are the log returns at time $t$, $\mu_t$ is so-called mean equation at time $t$ and $a_t$ is the
shock[^shock] at time $t$. The mean equation is a model that describes the expected value at time $t$, given
all information up to $t-1$. It can be a simple $AR(p)$ or $ARIMA(p, d, q)$ process that is stationary. Shock at time
$t$ describes the volatility at time $t$ with $\sqrt{\sigma^2}$ and a random noise. This shock is the main focus of volatility 
modeling \parencite[Fig. 3.2]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}.

[^shock]: Some authors uses also the word *innovation*.

Let shock $a_t$ be defined as

$$
a_t = \sigma_t \epsilon_t,
$$

where $\epsilon_t$ represents a sequence of identically and independently distributed random variable with $\mu = 0$
and $\sigma^2 = 1$ and $\sigma_t$ is an autoregressive process

$$
\sigma^2 = \alpha_0 + \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i a_{t-i}^2.
$$ {#eq-var-arch}

Put together, the model is called Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) model of order $m$. Equation @eq-var-arch
states that the variance at time $t$ is affected by squared residuals at the previous $m$ times. This implies
that, if the volatility has been high, the volatility at time $t$ is expected to be high as well. On the contrary,
in periods of low volatility, the expected volatility at time $t$ is rather small. It is important to realize
that high volatility does not necessarily imply high realized variability. The probability of very high or very low
returns is greater, but not guaranteed \parencite[Chap. 3.4]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}.

The random variable $\epsilon_t$ is often assumed to follow standard normal distribution. If the time series
experiences heavy tails, the student distribution might be more suitable. Since the expected value of such 
distributions are zero, the expected return at time $t$ is not affected and by it holds \parencite[Chap. 3.4.1]
{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime} that 

$$
E(p_t) = E(\mu_t) + E(a_t) = E(\mu_t).
$$


Because $\sigma^2$ is variance, it must be greater than zero and such, $\alpha_0 > 0$ and $\alpha_i \geq 0$ for 
$i \in \mathbb{N}$. The shock $a_t$ is split into two parts.

In frequentist statistics, there are several ways how to estimate the correct order of ARCH(m). One of them is the 
Ljung-Box statistic $Q(m)$ computed from the squared residuals $a_i^2$. Another popular method is the Lagrange
multiplier test, that is identical to the classic F-test in multiple regression. To estimate such model, maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) with different likelihood functions is commonly used. Because these thesis focuses 
primarily on bayesian methods and estimation, these methods will not be leveraged and further description and
application is offered in \parencite[Chap. 3]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime}.

To use the ARCH(m) model for forecasting, it is necessary to estimate historical residuals. One-step forecast for
ARCH(m) model is made up of the mean equation that is, in general, not affected by the forecasted volatility. After
computing historical predictions $\hat\mu_t$, it is necessary to compute residuals, which represent the historical
shock as

$$
a_t = y_t - \hat \mu_t.
$$

These residual shocks are then used in the ARCH(m) model to forecast future volatility as

$$
\sigma_{t+1}^2 = \alpha_0 + \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i a^2_{t - i + 1}.
$$

Forecasting equation can be generalized for arbitrary $\ell$-step ahead prediction

In practice, \parencite[Chap. 3.4.2]{Tsay2005_AnalysisFinancialTime} defines downsides of such models. One of them 
is the assumption that positive and negative spikes of residuals have the same effect on the current volatility.
Research has found that this is not true and squared historical shocks might not correctly reflect the true
shock. ARCH models also tend to overestimate volatility in cases where a single shock has been observed. Simple ARCH
models respond slowly to such quick changes and might not offer the best performance.
