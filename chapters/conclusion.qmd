This thesis connected financial time-series data analysis with bayesian models for conditional volatility.
The first part focused on introducing time series analysis and what are their specifics in terms of statistical
properties. Emphasis is also put on the definition of time series data and it's properties, such as stationarity or
mean function. Time series introduction follows conditional heteroskedastic models, a method of capturing volatility of
various time series data through two main methodologies. Models ARCH and GARCH which assume that volatility can be
explained by squared historical residuals and historical conditional heteroskedasticity are introduced, their
assumptions are explained and their practicality is motivated through various papers that apply models on real data.
Models of stochastic volatility that work with a latent variable are further introduced and their use is also motivated
through real-life research. Various modifications, such as GARCH-M models, are also mentioned as they are relevant
in non-stationary time-series dat analysis.

Second part focuses on bayesian statistics and introduces the concept of subjective and objective probability through
the historical development of both approaches. A comparison between both approaches is described and both benefits as
well as drawbacks of bayesian statistics are discussed. An emphasis is also put on ways how to describe the posterior
distribution or the quality of convergence. Sampling methods are motivated through the Bayes' theorem and it's
simplified kernel version. This is followed by an overview of several simulation methods that are able to draw
samples from a posterior distribution that is not analytically tractable. All six sampling methods are explained and
their specifics are defined. Their use is introduced through literature review that either applies specific algorithms
or compares the between them. An important distinction between precise and approximate methods is highlighted as they
are applicable in different domains. The second chapter finishes with an overview of literature review that
investigates how has been models of conditional heteroskedasticity applied alongside the bayesian mindset.

The final part applies all three models on time series data. Initially, all three models are used on the closing price
of NVDA stock that is inspected through autocorrelation functions to investigate whether heteroskedasticity or
volatility clustering might be problematic. After that, prior distribution are set and the models are estimated using
the Stan software. Different orders of ARCH and GARCH models are compared and a single best one is selected. The best
models based on visual analysis and the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation score are ARCH$(5)$ and GARCH$(5, 1)$, which are
then interpreted using bayesian tools. Only one model of stochastic volatility is estimated, however, it can be seen
that it performs the best out of all other models. The SV model is able to capture well volatility clusters, high
volatility peaks and does not overestimate volatility after big jumps.

The second time series analysis focuses on the closing price of TUI1.DE and after initial exploratory analysis employs
only the SV model. The prior distribution is identical to the first analysis, because their limitations are shared.
Interestingly, the estimated posterior distributions are very similar, which suggest that the underlying volatility
between NVDA and TUI1.DE might be related. The model is able to capture well periods of volatility clustering and does
not overestimate periods where volatility is relatively high.

This thesis could be extended by comparing different models on the raw closing price instead of focusing on the log
returns. This would enable out-of-sample predictions of the price, which could be sometimes more beneficial. Another
improvement would be by implementing a LFO-CV validation technique that can potentially better asses the quality of
individual models.
