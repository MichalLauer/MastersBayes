This thesis connected financial time-series data analysis with Bayesian models for conditional volatility. The first
part focused on introducing time series analysis and their specifics regarding statistical properties. Emphasis is also
put on the definition of time series data and properties, such as stationarity or mean function. Time series
introduction follows conditional heteroskedastic models, which capture the volatility of various time series data
through two main methodologies. Models ARCH and GARCH, which assume that volatility can be explained by squared
historical residuals and historical conditional heteroskedasticity, are introduced, their assumptions are explained and
their practicality is motivated through various papers that apply models on real data. Models of stochastic volatility
that work with a latent variable are further introduced and their use is also motivated through real-life research.
Various modifications, such as GARCH-M models, are also mentioned as they are relevant in non-stationary time-series
data analysis.

The second part focuses on Bayesian statistics and introduces the concept of subjective and objective probability
through the historical development of both approaches. A comparison between both approaches is described, and both
benefits and drawbacks of Bayesian statistics are discussed. An emphasis is also put on describing the posterior
distribution or convergence quality. Sampling methods are motivated through Bayes' theorem and it has a simplified
kernel version. This topic is followed by an overview of several simulation methods that can draw samples from a
posterior distribution that is not analytically tractable. All six sampling methods are explained, and their specifics
are defined. Their use is introduced through a literature review that either applies specific algorithms or compares
them between them. An important distinction between precise and approximate methods is highlighted as they are
applicable in different domains. The second chapter finishes with an overview of the literature review that
investigates how models of conditional heteroskedasticity have applied alongside the Bayesian mindset.

The final part applies all three models to time series data. Initially, all three models are used on the closing price
of NVDA stock that is inspected through autocorrelation functions to investigate whether heteroskedasticity or
volatility clustering might be problematic. After that, prior distributions are set, and the models are estimated using
the Stan software. Different orders of ARCH and GARCH models are compared, and a single best one is selected. The best
models based on visual analysis and the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation score are ARCH$(5)$ and GARCH$(5, 1)$, which are
then interpreted using Bayesian tools. Only one stochastic volatility model is estimated; however, it can be seen that
it performs the best out of all other models. The SV model can capture high volatility clusters and high volatility
peaks and does not overestimate volatility after big jumps.

The second time series analysis focuses on the closing price of TUI1.DE and, after initial exploratory analysis employs
only the SV model. The prior distribution is identical to the first analysis because their limitations are shared.
Interestingly, the estimated posterior distributions are very similar, which suggests that the underlying volatility
between NVDA and TUI1.DE might be related. The model can capture well periods of volatility clustering and does not
overestimate periods where volatility is relatively high.

This thesis could be extended by comparing different models on the raw closing price instead of focusing on the log
returns. This improvement would enable out-of-sample price predictions, which could sometimes be more beneficial.
Another improvement would be implementing an LFO-CV validation technique that can better assess individual models'
quality.
