Extension of ARCH models are generalized ARCH models introduced in Section @sec-garch. Its conditional variance, given
in Equation @eq-var-garch, can be relatively easily defined using Bayesian methods. The assumption about random
component $\epsilon$ is identical to the ARCH model, and usually, either the normal distribution or the student
distribution is selected. The main difference lies in additional $\beta$ coefficients representing the lagged
conditional variance effect. Requirements outlined in Section @sec-garch also add that for a stable GARCH model, the
sum of paired coefficients at lag $i$ must be less than one.
\parencite[Chap. 5.1]{GewekeEtAl2013_OxfordHandbookBayesian} notes that this condition can be met by discarding draws
that do not fulfill this assumption; however, this might not be very efficient.

If the shock $\epsilon$ is modeled using Student's distribution, the prior distribution on degrees of freedom $\nu$
must be a proper probability distribution that decreases faster than $1/\nu$. Otherwise, the posterior does not
integrate \parencite[Chap. 5.1]{GewekeEtAl2013_OxfordHandbookBayesian}. Some authors use the right side of a truncated
Cauchy distribution, which decreases faster. However, student distribution could be worrisome if the estimated degrees
of freedom are small. In such cases, some central moments do not exist, and a mixture of normal normal distributions is
more suitable \parencite 2.2]{VirbickaiteEtAl2015_BAYESIANINFERENCEMETHODS}.

The prior distribution for parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ varies.
\parencite{BauwensLubrano1998_BayesianInferenceGARCH} uses flat uniform priors and
\parencite{AusinGaleano2007_BayesianEstimationGaussian} conducts sensitivity analysis and finds that a change from
uniform to beta priors does not cause large differences in the posterior distribution.

The estimation of such a model requires MCMC methods because the posterior distribution is not analytically tractable.
\parencite[Chap. 5.1]{GewekeEtAl2013_OxfordHandbookBayesian} notes that the analytical conditional posterior
distribution for each parameter is unknown, and the Gibbs sampler is also inadequate for this model.
\parencite{VirbickaiteEtAl2015_BAYESIANINFERENCEMETHODS} also acknowledges this limitation and
\parencite{BauwensLubrano1998_BayesianInferenceGARCH} suggest an alternative called Griddy-Gibbs sampler. The
estimation of the GARCH model may be complex, and fine-tuning specific MCMC algorithms might be needed for efficient
convergence. \parencite{Ardia2008_BayesGARCHBayesianEstimation} offers an R package `{bayesGARCH}` that offers
automatic estimation of GARCH$(1, 1)$ model with shock that has Student distribution. This process is fully automatic
and uses MHA with fine-tuned proposal distribution made up of auxiliary ARMA processes. Many new samplers and methods
have also been devoted to GARCH model estimation. An overview of some of them can be found in
\parencite{VirbickaiteEtAl2015_BAYESIANINFERENCEMETHODS} or
\parencite[Chap. 5.1]{GewekeEtAl2013_OxfordHandbookBayesian}. Stan code for a general GARCH model can be found in Code
\ref{code-garch}.
