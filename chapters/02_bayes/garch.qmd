Extension of ARCH models are generalized ARCH models introduced in Section @sec-garch. It's conditional variance, given in Equation @eq-var-garch,
can be relatively easily defined using bayesian methods. The assumption about random component $\epsilon$ is identical to ARCH model,
and usually either normal distribution or the student distribution is selected. The main difference lies in additional $\beta$ coefficients
that represent the effect of lagged conditional variance. Requirements outlined in Section @sec-garch also add that for a stable GARCH model,
the sum of paired coefficients at lag $i$ need to be less than one. \parencite[Chap. 5.1]{GewekeEtAl2013_OxfordHandbookBayesian} notes that
this condition can be met by discarding draws which do not fulfill this assumption, however this might not be
very efficient.

If the shock $\epsilon$ is modeled using Student's distribution, the prior distribution on degrees of freedom $\nu$ must be a proper 
probability distribution that decreases faster than $1/\nu$. Otherwise, the posterior does not integrate 
\parencite[Chap. 5.1]{GewekeEtAl2013_OxfordHandbookBayesian}. Some author use right side of a truncated Cauchy distribution, which decreases faster.
However, student distribution could be worrisome if the estimated degrees of freedom are small. Because of this, some central moments do not exists and
another approaches are more suitable. In such cases, a mixture of normal normal distributions might be more suitable 
\parencite[Chap. 2.2]{VirbickaiteEtAl2015_BAYESIANINFERENCEMETHODS}.

The prior distribution for parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ varies. \parencite{BauwensLubrano1998_BayesianInferenceGARCH} uses flat uniform priors
and \parencite{AusinGaleano2007_BayesianEstimationGaussian} conducts sensitivity analysis and finds that a change from uniform to beta priors does 
not cause large differences in the posterior distribution.

The estimation of such model requires MCMC methods, because the posterior distribution is not analytically tractable.
\parencite[Chap. 5.1]{GewekeEtAl2013_OxfordHandbookBayesian} notes that the analytical conditional posterior distribution for each parameter
is not known, and Gibbs sampler is also not adequate for this model. \parencite{VirbickaiteEtAl2015_BAYESIANINFERENCEMETHODS} also acknowledges this
limitation and \parencite{BauwensLubrano1998_BayesianInferenceGARCH} suggest an alternative called Griddy-Gibbs sampler. 
The estimation of GARCH model may be complex and fine-tuning of specific
MCMC algorithms might be needed for an efficient convergence. \parencite{Ardia2008_BayesGARCHBayesianEstimation} offers an R 
package `{bayesGARCH}` that offers automatic estimation of GARCH$(1, 1)$ model with shock that has Student distribution. This process is fully
automatic and uses MHA with fine-tuned proposal distribution made up of auxiliary ARMA processes. Additionally, a great number of new samplers
and methods have been devoted to GARCH model estimation. Overview of some of them can be found in 
\parencite{VirbickaiteEtAl2015_BAYESIANINFERENCEMETHODS} or
\parencite[Chap. 5.1]{GewekeEtAl2013_OxfordHandbookBayesian}. Stan code for a general GARCH model can be found in Code \ref{code-garch}.
