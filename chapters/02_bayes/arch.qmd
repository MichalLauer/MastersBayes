ARCH model introduced in Equation @eq-var-arch was a \enquote{quantum jump} for modeling of stochasticity 
\parencite[Chap. 5]{GewekeEtAl2013_OxfordHandbookBayesian}. It is natural to model such model in a bayesian framework. Given the equation shock

$$
a_t = \sigma_t \epsilon_t,
$$

it is necessary to first set apriori distribution for innovation $\epsilon_t$. It is traditionally assumed to have standard normal distribution, and
in cases with fatter tails, the student distribution. This implies that the final model will need to estimate either the variance $\sigma^2_\epsilon$ or
degrees of freedom $\nu_\epsilon$.

The conditional volatility $\sigma_t$ is deterministically composed of historical values and does not have any apriori distribution specified. It is
composed of intercept $\alpha_0$ and coefficients $\alpha_i$ for every squared historical residual that is considered, generally for $i = 1, \dots, m$.
The apriori distribution for every coefficient need to respect the non-negativity of volatility and conditions set in Section @sec-arch. 

\parencite[Chap. 1]{AriPapadopoulos2016_BayesianEstimationParameters} sets the apriori distribution for $\alpha_0$ to be Gamma with parameters $r$ and 
$\beta$. The gamma distribution is strictly positive and positively skewed. It represent the instantinuous volatility at time $t$. For other 
coefficients $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_m$, they assume joint dirichlet apriori distribution with parameters $\omega_1, \dots, \omega_m$. 
Dirichlet distribution is a multivariate beta distribution whose coordinates in $m$-dimensional space always sum to one. This fulfills the assumptions
for a stable ARCH mode and the individual coefficients are assumed to be independent. Authors set the distribution of $\epsilon$ to be normally
distributed and conveniently call such model *Normal-ARCH(m)*. Interestingly, authors did not use MCMC methods but a Lindsey approximation that
leverages Taylor series. As the authors themselves note, this method is not suitable for complicated models and an be used in a limited manner.

\parencite{KaufmannFruhwirth-Schnatter2002_BayesianAnalysisSwitching} analyses switching ARCH models and their use of the Dirichlet distribution 
for coefficients $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_m$ is identical, as well as the use of normal distribution with parameter $\mu_\epsilon$ and 
$\sigma^2_\epsilon$ for $\epsilon$. However, authors chose an Inverse-Gamma distribution for intercepts[^interps] $\alpha_0$ that is 
also bound by zero. Compares to a gamma distribution, it has heavier tails and might be more suitable for models where extreme values are to be 
expected.

[^interps]: The model contains multiple intercepts because it *switches* them based on time.

Both papers use custom, non-informative priors. Since this model is relatively non-complex, standard MCMC methods are sufficient. The implementation
of ARCH model in Stan can be seen in Appendix #TODO.
