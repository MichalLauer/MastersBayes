ARCH model introduced in Equation @eq-var-arch was a \enquote{quantum jump} for modeling of stochasticity
\parencite[Chap. 5]{GewekeEtAl2013_OxfordHandbookBayesian}. It is natural to model such a model in a Bayesian
framework. Given the equation shock

$$
a_t = \sigma_t \epsilon_t,
$$

it is necessary first to set prior distribution for innovation $\epsilon_t$. It is traditionally assumed to have
standard normal distribution and in cases with fatter tails, the student distribution. The conditional volatility
$\sigma_t$ is deterministically composed of historical values and does not specify any prior distribution. It is
composed of intercept $\alpha_0$ and coefficients $\alpha_i$ for every squared historical residual that is considered,
generally for $i = 1, \dots, p$. The prior distribution for every coefficient must respect the non-negativity of
volatility and conditions set in Section @sec-arch.

\parencite[Chap. 1]{AriPapadopoulos2016_BayesianEstimationParameters} sets the prior distribution for $\alpha_0$ to be
Gamma with parameters $r$ and $\beta$. The gamma distribution is strictly positive and positively skewed. It represents
the instantaneous volatility at time $t$. For other coefficients $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_p$, they assume joint
dirichlet prior distribution with parameters $\omega_1, \dots, \omega_p$. Dirichlet distribution is a multivariate beta
distribution whose coordinates in $p$-dimensional space always sum to one. This distribution fulfills the assumptions
for a stable ARCH mode, and the individual coefficients are assumed to be independent. Authors set the distribution of
$\epsilon$ to be normally distributed and conveniently call such model *Normal-ARCH(p)*. Interestingly, the authors did
not use MCMC methods but a Lindsey approximation that leverages the Taylor series. As the authors note, this method is
unsuitable for complicated models and can be used in a limited manner.

\parencite{KaufmannFruhwirth-Schnatter2002_BayesianAnalysisSwitching} analyses switching ARCH models and their use of
the Dirichlet distribution for coefficients $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_p$ is identical, as well as the use of normal
distribution with parameter $\mu_\epsilon$ and $\sigma^2_\epsilon$ for $\epsilon$. However, the authors chose an
Inverse-Gamma distribution for intercepts[^interps] $\alpha_0$ bound by zero. Compared to a gamma distribution, it has
heavier tails and might be more suitable for models where extreme values are to be expected.

[^interps]: The model contains multiple intercepts because it *switches* them based on time.

Both papers use custom, non-informative priors. Since this model is relatively non-complex, standard MCMC methods are
sufficient. The implementation of ARCH model in Stan can be seen in Code \ref{code-arch}.
