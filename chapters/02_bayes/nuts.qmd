No-U-Turn Samples (NUTS) is a special adaptive technique applied in HMC proposed by
\parencite{HoffmanGelman2011_NoUTurnSamplerAdaptively}. Authors note that the cost of a single independent sample for a
$d$-dimensional model in HMC is $O(d^{5/4})$, which is much higher than the cost of a single MA sample $O(d^2)$. The
efficiency of HMC can be greatly affected by two hyperparameters: the scale factor $\epsilon$ and the number of
leapfrogs $L$. Authors argue that current adaptive algorithms can fine-tune parameter $\epsilon$ during the warmup
phase; however, optimizing $L$ is more difficult. They propose a new NUTS that eliminates the need to manually set the
number of steps $L$, which can increase the widespread use of HMC.

The main idea that authors propose is a *\enquote{criterion to tell us when we have simulated the dynamics for long
enough, i.e., when simulating more steps would no longer increase the distance between the proposal $\theta^*$ and the
initial value of $\theta_{t-1}$}.* The criterion that the authors propose is

$$
(\theta^* - \theta^{t-1}) \phi.
$$ {#eq-nuts-crit}

The distance between proposal $\theta^*$ and the initial state $\theta^{t-1}$ is multiplied by the current momentum
$\phi$. Ideally, the algorithm should run until the criterion in Equation @eq-nuts-crit is less than zero and the
proposal is \enquote{coming back in a circle}[^nuts-circle]. This condition is not computationally feasible and might
not always be possible. The authors propose a new slice variable $u$, that is used during sampling and solves this
issue. The original paper outlines a detailed explanation with additional proofs, algorithm description, and
implementation.

[^nuts-circle]: Although not stated in the original paper, this might motivate the name *No-U-Turn*.

\parencite[Chap. 4.4]{HoffmanGelman2011_NoUTurnSamplerAdaptively} details that NUTS is at least as good as a vanilla
HMC, which makes NUTS often the preferable choice. \parencite{WuEtAl2018_FasterHamiltonianMonte} suggest that the NUTS
has become the standard sampler for Bayesian models.
