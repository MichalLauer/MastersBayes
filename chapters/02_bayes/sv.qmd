The use of SV models in bayesian statistics is natural because of several reasons. First, the flexibility to define
various prior distributions to parameters can improve efficiency, speed and quality of estimation. The use of MCMC to
estimate the posterior distribution is also employed in frequentist statistics.
\parencite{Ait-SahaliaKimmel2007_MaximumLikelihoodEstimation} combines Monte Carlo simulations with maximum likelihood
estimates to derive the volatility of option price. Authors are able to derive a closed-form solution that has desired
statistical properties and can be used on real data analysis. \parencite{AndersenEtAl1999_EfficientMethodMoments}
combines Monte Carlo simulations with methods of moments an extensive study that evaluates the sensitivity to sample
size.

SV models are also popular amongst bayesian time series analysis.
\parencite{YangEtAl2021_AnalysisVolatilityCharacteristics} uses SV-N and SV-T models to explore the characteristics of
Chinese and American Financial Markets. Authors state that SV models are *\enquote{essential models in the field of
financial time series research, which can better characterize the time-varying characteristics of volatility.}*
Authors compare models with the DIC criteria and the observe that the mean volatility is greater in US Stock markets.

In a complex models where leverage effect and jumps are present, more advanced approaches are required.
\parencite{XieShen2023_BayesianEstimationStochastic} proposes a new generalized skewed Student's distribution that is
able to capture time series with heavy tails and leptokurtosis. Furthermore,
\parencite{WangChan2023_StochasticModellingVolatility} uses multivariate SV models to explain volatility in electricity
markets in Australia. Although the authors state that *\enquote{SV models have demonstrated their superiority in many
financial applications}*, their use in electricity markets is quite limited. They propose a new model that connect
SV models and Granger causality for efficient volatility modeling. Basic SV model implemented in Stan can be found in
Code \ref{code-sv}.
