The use of SV models in Bayesian statistics is natural for several reasons. First, the flexibility to define various
prior distributions to parameters can improve efficiency, speed, and estimation quality. Using MCMC to estimate the
posterior distribution is also employed in frequentist statistics.
\parencite{Ait-SahaliaKimmel2007_MaximumLikelihoodEstimation} combines Monte Carlo simulations with maximum likelihood
estimates to derive option price volatility. Authors can derive a closed-form solution with desired statistical
properties and be used in real data analysis. \parencite{AndersenEtAl1999_EfficientMethodMoments} combines Monte Carlo
simulations with methods of moments, an extensive study that evaluates the sensitivity to sample size.

SV models are also popular amongst Bayesian time series analysis.
\parencite{YangEtAl2021_AnalysisVolatilityCharacteristics} uses SV-N and SV-T models to explore the characteristics of
Chinese and American Financial Markets. Authors state that SV models are *\enquote{essential models in financial time
series research, which can better characterize the time-varying characteristics of volatility.}* The authors compare
models with the DIC criteria and observe that the mean volatility is greater in US Stock markets.

More advanced approaches are required in complex models where leverage effect and jumps are present.
\parencite{XieShen2023_BayesianEstimationStochastic} proposes a new generalized skewed Student's distribution that can
capture time series with heavy tails and leptokurtosis. Furthermore,
\parencite{WangChan2023_StochasticModellingVolatility} uses multivariate SV models to explain volatility in electricity
markets in Australia. Although the authors state that *\enquote{SV models have demonstrated their superiority in many
financial applications}*, their use in electricity markets is limited. They propose a new model that connects SV models
and Granger causality for efficient volatility modeling. The basic SV model implemented in Stan can be found in Code
\ref{code-sv}.
