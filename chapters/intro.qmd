This thesis combines two domains that are growing in popularity, complexity, and importance. The first is Bayesian
statistics, a novel approach to statistical modeling that considers probability to be subjective rather than objective.
The second matter is regarding volatility modeling where heteroskedasticity of time series needs to be considered.

Bayesian statistics allows building models and drawing conclusions using already known facts or studies. Instead of
focusing solely on the relative frequency of some event, bayesian methods can incorporate prior knowledge about the
estimated parameters through a probability distribution representing a degree of belief before observing any new data.
It also naturally allows the researcher to quantify uncertainty through a posterior distribution that can be used to
create probabilistic statements about the estimated parameters. In small samples, bayesian methods use prior knowledge
to improve the quality of estimates and can offer better results than estimates that rely on asymptotic
properties.

Analysis of the volatility of financial markets in the current digital world is important, and
\parencite{Liu2024NavigatingTF} provides at least two domains where this might be beneficial. Assessing the volatility
of markets can help with portfolio optimization and risk management. Studies found that the inclusion of GARCH models,
which are the topic of this thesis, has led to a 20% decrease in portfolio volatility. This further helps management
and traders mitigate potential losses and improve decision-making. Another popular domain is derivative markets for
futures or options, where setting the right price is crucial. Historically, option pricing uses methods such as the
Black-Scholes model, which assumes that the variance of the underlying asset is constant. This assumption does not
always hold in practice, and the need to support heteroskedasticity in financial time series arose.

The connection between Bayesian statistical thinking and financial markets is interesting in several ways. First, some
advanced models capable of measuring volatility are hard to estimate, and Bayesian methods naturally arise, especially
in the case of stochastic volatility. Furthermore, Bayesian statistics provides richer information than traditional
methods by generating a complete posterior distribution, not just point or interval estimates. From this distribution,
you can calculate any desired points, quantiles, or intervals. This comprehensive approach enables more sophisticated
decision-making and provides deeper insights into the quantities being estimated. Additionally, Bayesian probability
interpretations are often more intuitive and practical than the traditional frequentist concept of \enquote{imaginary
repetitions in identical conditions}.

This thesis has two main parts. The theoretical part describes financial markets, volatility models, and their
application in Bayesian statistics. These models are then used in the practical part on time series from financial
markets, where the underlying volatility is captured. The structure is divided into three main chapters. The first
chapter explores financial time series and their statistical characteristics. Classical models which are used
throughout the thesis are also defined and described. The second part focuses on Bayesian statistics. First, the ideas
behind Bayesian statistics are introduced, as well as model definitions, statistical inferences, and the creation of
posterior distributions. After that, different sampling methods are used, which are crucial in models where analytical
posterior distribution is not tractable. Finally, the application of volatility models and Bayesian statistics is shown
using available studies and surveys. The last chapter focuses on data analysis in R
\parencite{RCoreTeam2023_LanguageEnvironmentStatistical} and Stan
\parencite{CarpenterEtAl2017_StanProbabilisticProgramming}.
