This thesis combines two domains which are growing in their popularity, complexity and importance. The first is 
bayesian statistics, a novel approach to statistical modeling and probability that is considered to be
subjective rather than objective. The second matter is regarding volatility modeling where heteroskedasticity
of time series needs to be considered.

Bayesian statistics allows building models and drawin conclusions using already known facts or studies. Instead of focusing
solely on the relative frequency of some event, bayesian methods can incorporate prior knowledge about the estimated
parameters through a probability distribution that represents a degree of belief before observing any new data.
It also naturally allows the researcher to quantify uncertainity through a posterior distribution that can be used
to create probabilistic statements about the estimated parameters. In small samples, bayesian methods use prior
knowledge to improve estimation of unknown parameters and can offer better results than estimates that relly
on asymptotic properties.

Analysis of volatility of financial markets in the current digital world is important and \parencite{Liu2024NavigatingTF} provides at least 2 domains
where this might be beneficial. Assessing the volatility of markets can help with portfolio optimization and risk management. Studies
found that the inclusion of GARCH models, which are the topic of this thesis, has lead to a 20 % decrease in portfolio volatility. This
further helps management and traders mitigate potential losses and improve decision making. Another popular domain are derivative markets
for futures or options where setting the right price is crucial. Historically, option pricing uses methods such as the Black Scholes model,
which assumes that the variance of the underlying asset is constant. This assumption does not always hold in practice, and the need to support
heteroskedasticity in financial time series arose.

The bridge between novel bayesian statistical thinking and financial markets that can affect everyday life is interesting in several ways. First,
some advanced models that are capable of measuring volatility in financial markets are hard to estimate and bayesian methods naturally arise,
especially in the case of stochastic volatility. Furthermore, bayesian statistics offer information not only point and interval estimates, but in a 
full posterior distribution from which arbitrary points, quantiles and intervals are computable. This supports advanced decision making and 
offers more information about the estimated quantities. The probabilistic interpretation that can also be more natural and helpful rather than
\enquote{imaginary repetitions in identical conditions}.

This thesis has two main parts. The theoretical part contains description of financial markets, volatility models and 
their application in bayesian statistics. These 
models are then used in practical part on time series from financial markets, where the underlying volatility is captured. The structure is divided
into three main chapters. First chapter explores financial time serie and their statistical characteristics. Classical models which are used
throughout the thesis are also defined and described. The second part focuses on bayesian statistics. First, the ideas behind bayesian statistics
are introduced as well as model definition, statistical inference and the creation of posterior distributions. After that, different sampling methods
are used which are crucial in models where analytical posterior distribution is not tractable. Finally, the application of volatility models
and bayesian statistics is drawn using available studies and surveys. The last chapter focuses on data analysis in R 
\parencite{RCoreTeam2023_LanguageEnvironmentStatistical} and Stan \parencite{CarpenterEtAl2017_StanProbabilisticProgramming}.
