  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Financials have been concerned constantly with factors that have impact on both taking and assessing various financial decisions in firms. Hence modelling volatility in financial markets is one of the factors that have direct role and effect on pricing, risk and portfolio management. Therefore, this study aims to examine the volatility characteristics on Jordan’s capital market that include; clustering volatility, leptokurtosis, and leverage effect. This objective can be accomplished by selecting symmetric and asymmetric models from GARCH family models. This study applies; ARCH, GARCH, and EGARCH to investigate the behavior of stock return volatility for Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) covering the period from Jan. 1 2005 through Dec.31 2014. The main findings suggest that the symmetric ARCH /GARCH models can capture characteristics of ASE, and provide more evidence for both volatility clustering and leptokurtic, whereas EGARCH output reveals no support for the existence of leverage effect in the stock returns at Amman Stock Exchange.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {This book is an ambitious effort by three well-known and well-respected scholars to fill an acknowledged void in the literature—a text covering the burgeoning  field of empirical finance. As the authors note in the preface, there are several excellent books covering financial theory at a level suitable for a Ph.D. class or as a reference for academics and practitioners, but there is little or nothing similar that covers econometric methods and applications. Perhaps the closest existing text is the recent addition to the Wiley               Series in Financial and Quantitative Analysis               .  written by Cuthbertson (1996). The major difference between the books is that Cuthbertson focuses exclusively on asset pricing in the stock, bond, and foreign exchange markets, whereas Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (henceforth CLM) consider empirical applications throughout the field of finance, including corporate finance, derivatives markets, and market microstructure. The level of anticipation preceding publication can be partly measured by the fact that at least three reviews (including this one) have appeared since the book arrived. Moreover, in their reviews, both Harvey (1998) and Tiso (1998) comment on the need for such a text, a sentiment that has been echoed by numerous finance academics.},

  abstract = {Se utilizan siete modelos GARCH y de volatilidad estocástica (SV) para modelar y comparar empíricamente la volatilidad de los rendimientos de cuatro materias primas: oro, cobre, petróleo y gas natural. Los resultados muestran evidencia de colas gruesas y saltos aleatorios creados por desequilibrios de oferta / demanda, episodios de inestabilidad internacional, tensiones geopolíticas y especulación de mercado, entre otros factores. También encontramos evidencia de un efecto apalancamiento en el petróleo y el cobre, derivado de su dependencia de la actividad económica mundial; y de un efecto apalancamiento inverso en oro y gas natural, consistente con el papel del primero como activo seguro y con la incertidumbre sobre la oferta futura del segundo. Además, en la mayoría de los casos no hay evidencia de un impacto de la volatilidad en la media. Finalmente, encontramos que los modelos de volatilidad de rendimiento con mejor desempeño son GARCH-t para el oro.},

  abstract = {In this paper, Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods are exploited to provide a unified, practical likelihood-based framework for the analysis of stochastic volatility models. A highly effective method is developed that samples all the unobserved volatilities at once using an approximating offset mixture model, followed by an importance reweighting procedure. This approach is compared with several alternative methods using real data. The paper also develops simulation-based methods for filtering, likelihood evaluation and model failure diagnostics. The issue of model choice using non-nested likelihood ratios and Bayes factors is also investigated. These methods are used to compare the fit of stochastic volatility and GARCH models. All the procedures are illustrated in detail.},
