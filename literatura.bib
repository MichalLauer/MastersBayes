	abstract = {This book is an ambitious effort by three well-known and
well-respected scholars to fill an acknowledged void in the
literature—a text covering the burgeoning 
field of empirical finance.
As the authors note in the preface, there are several excellent books
covering financial theory at a level suitable for a Ph.D. class or as
a reference for academics and practitioners, but there is little or
nothing similar that covers econometric methods and applications.
Perhaps the closest existing text is the recent addition to the Wiley
              Series in Financial and Quantitative Analysis
              . 
written by Cuthbertson
(1996). The major difference between the books is that Cuthbertson
focuses exclusively on asset pricing in the stock, bond, and foreign
exchange markets, whereas Campbell, Lo, and {MacKinlay} (henceforth {CLM})
consider empirical applications throughout the field of finance,
including corporate finance, derivatives markets, and market
microstructure. The level of anticipation preceding publication
can be partly measured by the fact that at least three reviews
(including this one) have appeared since the book arrived. Moreover,
in their reviews, both Harvey (1998) and Tiso (1998) comment on the
need for such a text, a sentiment that has been echoed by numerous
finance academics.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Financials have been concerned constantly with factors that have impact on both taking and assessing various financial decisions in firms. Hence modelling volatility in financial markets is one of the factors that have direct role and effect on pricing, risk and portfolio management. Therefore, this study aims to examine the volatility characteristics on Jordan’s capital market that include; clustering volatility, leptokurtosis, and leverage effect. This objective can be accomplished by selecting symmetric and asymmetric models from {GARCH} family models. This study applies; {ARCH}, {GARCH}, and {EGARCH} to investigate the behavior of stock return volatility for Amman Stock Exchange ({ASE}) covering the period from Jan. 1 2005 through Dec.31 2014. The main findings suggest that the symmetric {ARCH} /{GARCH} models can capture characteristics of {ASE}, and provide more evidence for both volatility clustering and leptokurtic, whereas {EGARCH} output reveals no support for the existence of leverage effect in the stock returns at Amman Stock Exchange.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In this paper, Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods are exploited to provide a unified, practical likelihood-based framework for the analysis of stochastic volatility models. A highly effective method is developed that samples all the unobserved volatilities at once using an approximating offset mixture model, followed by an importance reweighting procedure. This approach is compared with several alternative methods using real data. The paper also develops simulation-based methods for filtering, likelihood evaluation and model failure diagnostics. The issue of model choice using non-nested likelihood ratios and Bayes factors is also investigated. These methods are used to compare the fit of stochastic volatility and {GARCH} models. All the procedures are illustrated in detail.},
