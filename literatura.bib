  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Financials have been concerned constantly with factors that have impact on both taking and assessing various financial decisions in firms. Hence modelling volatility in financial markets is one of the factors that have direct role and effect on pricing, risk and portfolio management. Therefore, this study aims to examine the volatility characteristics on Jordan’s capital market that include; clustering volatility, leptokurtosis, and leverage effect. This objective can be accomplished by selecting symmetric and asymmetric models from GARCH family models. This study applies; ARCH, GARCH, and EGARCH to investigate the behavior of stock return volatility for Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) covering the period from Jan. 1 2005 through Dec.31 2014. The main findings suggest that the symmetric ARCH /GARCH models can capture characteristics of ASE, and provide more evidence for both volatility clustering and leptokurtic, whereas EGARCH output reveals no support for the existence of leverage effect in the stock returns at Amman Stock Exchange.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Many people have flipped coins but few have stopped to ponder the statistical and physical intricacies of the process. In a preregistered study we collected \$350\{,\}757\$ coin flips to test the counterintuitive prediction from a physics model of human coin tossing developed by Diaconis, Holmes, and Montgomery (DHM; 2007). The model asserts that when people flip an ordinary coin, it tends to land on the same side it started -- DHM estimated the probability of a same-side outcome to be about 51\%. Our data lend strong support to this precise prediction: the coins landed on the same side more often than not, \$\textbackslash text\{Pr\}(\textbackslash text\{same side\}) = 0.508\$, 95\% credible interval (CI) [\$0.506\$, \$0.509\$], \$\textbackslash text\{BF\}\_\{\textbackslash text\{same-side bias\}\} = 2359\$. Furthermore, the data revealed considerable between-people variation in the degree of this same-side bias. Our data also confirmed the generic prediction that when people flip an ordinary coin -- with the initial side-up randomly determined -- it is equally likely to land heads or tails: \$\textbackslash text\{Pr\}(\textbackslash text\{heads\}) = 0.500\$, 95\% CI [\$0.498\$, \$0.502\$], \$\textbackslash text\{BF\}\_\{\textbackslash text\{heads-tails bias\}\} = 0.182\$. Furthermore, this lack of heads-tails bias does not appear to vary across coins. Additional exploratory analyses revealed that the within-people same-side bias decreased as more coins were flipped, an effect that is consistent with the possibility that practice makes people flip coins in a less wobbly fashion. Our data therefore provide strong evidence that when some (but not all) people flip a fair coin, it tends to land on the same side it started. Our data provide compelling statistical support for the DHM physics model of coin tossing.},

  abstract = {This book is an ambitious effort by three well-known and well-respected scholars to fill an acknowledged void in the literature—a text covering the burgeoning  field of empirical finance. As the authors note in the preface, there are several excellent books covering financial theory at a level suitable for a Ph.D. class or as a reference for academics and practitioners, but there is little or nothing similar that covers econometric methods and applications. Perhaps the closest existing text is the recent addition to the Wiley               Series in Financial and Quantitative Analysis               .  written by Cuthbertson (1996). The major difference between the books is that Cuthbertson focuses exclusively on asset pricing in the stock, bond, and foreign exchange markets, whereas Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (henceforth CLM) consider empirical applications throughout the field of finance, including corporate finance, derivatives markets, and market microstructure. The level of anticipation preceding publication can be partly measured by the fact that at least three reviews (including this one) have appeared since the book arrived. Moreover, in their reviews, both Harvey (1998) and Tiso (1998) comment on the need for such a text, a sentiment that has been echoed by numerous finance academics.},

Although introductory in its early sections, the book is definitely not elementary in the sense of a first text in statistics. The mathematics used in our book is basic probability and statistics, elementary calculus, and linear algebra. A review of probability notation is given in Chapter 1 along with a more detailed list of topics assumed to have been studied. The practical orientation of the book means that the reader's previous experience in probability, statistics, and linear algebra should ideally have included strong computational components. To write an introductory text alone would leave many readers with only a taste of the conceptual elements but no guidance for venturing into genuine practical applications, beyond those where Bayesian methods agree essentially with standard non-Bayesian analyses. On the other hand, we feel it would be a mistake to present the advanced methods without first introducing the basic concepts from our data-analytic perspective. Furthermore, due to the nature of applied statistics, a text on current Bayesian methodology would be incomplete without a variety of worked examples drawn from real applications. To avoid cluttering the main narrative, there are bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter and references at the end of the book"--},

(1953) and its generalizations have been increasingly popular in computational physics and, more recently, statistics, for sampling from intractable multivariate distributions. Much recent research has been devoted to increasing the efficiency of simulation algorithms by altering the jumping rules for Metropolis-like algorithms. We study a very specific question: What are the most efficient symmetric jumping kernels for simulating a normal target distribution using the Metropolis algorithmã We provide a general theoretical result as the dimension of a class of canonical problems goes to ∞ and numerical approximations and simulations for low-dimensional Gaussian target distributions that show that the limiting results provide extremely accurate approximations in six and higher dimensions.},

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

This approach is compared with several alternative methods using real data. The paper also develops simulation-based methods for filtering, likelihood evaluation and model failure diagnostics. The issue of model choice using non-nested likelihood ratios and Bayes factors is also investigated. These methods are used to compare the fit of stochastic volatility and GARCH models.

However, their computational efficiency is highly dependent on the chosen proposal distribution, which is generally difficult to find. One way to solve this problem is to use adaptive MCMC algorithms which automatically tune the statistics of a proposal distribution during the MCMC run. A new adaptive MCMC algorithm, called the variational Bayesian adaptive Metropolis (VBAM) algorithm, is developed. The VBAM algorithm updates the proposal covariance matrix using the variational Bayesian adaptive Kalman filter (VB-AKF). A strong law of large numbers for the VBAM algorithm is proven. The empirical convergence results for three simulated examples and for two real data examples are also provided.},

  abstract = {A general method, suitable for fast computing machines, for investigating such properties as equations of state for substances consisting of interacting individual molecules is described. The method consists of a modified Monte Carlo integration over configuration space. Results for the two-dimensional rigid-sphere system have been obtained on the Los Alamos MANIAC and are presented here. These results are compared to the free volume equation of state and to a four-term virial coefficient expansion.},
